# Czapa's 4coder custom layer

### What does it do:
The keybindings are modal and they are to some extent inspired by vim.
However I didn't want to just use 4coder_vim.cpp. I wanted to redesign the bindings to serve my purposes better. For now most of stuff in custom directory is taken from 4coder's default custom layer.
Names of files written or modified by me start with czapa.
Names of unchanged files from 4coder's default custom layer start with 4coder.

### Custom layer compilation:
Just drop custom directory and build.bat into 4coder directory; then run build.bat
If you want to compile lexer then run build_lexer_and_custom_layer.bat instead
